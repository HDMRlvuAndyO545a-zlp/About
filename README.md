## Summary
hello. Not sure what to say except that I'm a highschool student in his senior year since any and all other information about me would fit better on another section. With that in mind, here's a picture I found while trying to figure out pictures

## Hobbies
- Occasionally reading random books I find online. Most of them aren't that great but they're entertaining enough.
- Watching Japanese animation. Sometimes. I have a list of things to watch and it just keeps growing.
- Reading the source material of said animation(s) and having a smug expression because I know what happens later.
- Trying to learn JavaScript and looking it up when it's confusing. Many tabs are opened at such times.
- Being at rest whilst underneath layers of cotton-wool fabric in order to peruse the vast contents of the interwebs via a portable communications device, commonly not used for its intended purpose (Using the phone in bed).
